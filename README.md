# aerospace_failure_data
This project aims to predict failures in aerospace components using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of simulated operational conditions such as temperature, pressure, vibration, usage hours, mechanical stress, and material type. A failure label (0 = no failure, 1 = failure) is generated based on predefined thresholds.
