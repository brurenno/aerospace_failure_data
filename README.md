# aerospace_failure_data
This project aims to predict failures in aerospace components using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of simulated operational conditions such as temperature, pressure, vibration, usage hours, mechanical stress, and material type. A failure label (0 = no failure, 1 = failure) is generated based on predefined thresholds.
Aerospace Component Failure Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict failures in aerospace components using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of simulated operational conditions such as temperature, pressure, vibration, usage hours, mechanical stress, and material type. A failure label (0 = no failure, 1 = failure) is generated based on predefined thresholds.

Dataset

The dataset aerospace_failure_data.csv contains 5000 samples with the following features:

Temperature (Â°C) - Operating temperature

Pressure (kPa) - Operating pressure

Vibration (mm/s) - Vibration levels

Usage_Hours (hours) - Total hours in operation

Mechanical_Stress (MPa) - Stress experienced by the component

Material (Categorical) - Type of material used (Titanium, Aluminum, Composite)

Failure (Binary) - 1 if failure occurred, 0 otherwise
